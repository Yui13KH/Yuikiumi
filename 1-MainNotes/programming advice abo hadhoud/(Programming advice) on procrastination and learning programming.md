### 1. **University Graduates and Employability**

- **"95% of university graduates are unemployable because they have no applicable experience."**

### 2. **Programming ≠ Programming Language**

- Programming is not just about learning syntax.
- **"Syntax is useless if you can't solve problems."**

### 3. **Mention of PERL**

- The discussion mentions **PERL** but doesn’t dwell on it.

### 4. **No "Best Programming Language"**

- **"There is no 'best programming language'. It depends on what you want to do with it."**

### 5. **The Rush to Learn Programming**

- People often rush to learn programming, but **"_ahem ahem_"** they don’t focus on mastering the core principles.

### 6. **Programming as a Skill**

- **"Programming is like building a muscle."**
- Knowledge is useless if you can’t use it effectively. This is similar to how learning is useless without practice.
- **"I hate you, okay hate me but take my knowledge. No need to be emotionally involved. My simple info could change your life."**

### 7. **Becoming Good at Programming**

- It takes **at least 2 years** to become proficient in programming. By proficient, we mean earning **thousands of dollars**.
- Some people may get jobs after a course (e.g., **Odin**), but what type of job is it? A job paying $500–$1k is not considered a real job by many in the industry.
- **"Here, we work at multinational companies that pay $3k for front-end roles, not even backend."**

### 8. **Stereotypes and Job Applications**

- If you’re bad at programming and apply for jobs, you might unintentionally create negative stereotypes about your nationality.
    - Personal Example: **"As Syrians, my family believes most Egyptians are stupid."**

### 9. **Learning from Experience**

- **"It’s your right to get information from someone with experience. It’s your right to take lessons from someone who’s been through struggles."**

### 10. **Don't Learn JavaScript as a Foundation**

- **"You can’t build a solid foundation with JavaScript. The language has too many edge cases and issues."**
- JavaScript has been heavily criticized for its flaws and quirks.

### 11. **Avoid Technical Debt**

- Don’t rush into technical debt, even if you follow something like the **Odin Project** and land a job.
- The problem is that if you get a low-paying job, you won’t be motivated to improve your basics. This is like **real debt from a bank**: if you don’t pay it off, it multiplies over time.

### 12. **CS50 Course Critique**

- **"CS50 is an introductory computer science course, not the foundation for learning programming."**
- It’s often overhyped.

### 13. **Indifference to Criticism**

- Successful individuals **“don’t give a fuck about any of you."** They go on with their lives regardless of hate comments.

### 14. **Reality of Living in America**

- Don’t move to America just because you hear about $100k salaries.
- **"In reality, the cost of living is extremely high. For example, a single studio apartment can cost $2k–$3k a month."**

### 15. **CV Review Process**

- **"I get about 1,000 CVs in a day. If I can’t read your CV in less than 30 seconds, it goes in the trash."**

### 16. **Learning Frameworks**

- **"If your foundation is strong, you can learn an entire framework in a single day."**
- Don’t waste too much time on just one framework.

### 17. **Role Expectations in the Industry**

- Companies typically don’t hire specialists for every role. For example, you may not be hired solely as a UI/UX designer, but as a front-end developer with UI/UX skills.
- **"They usually want front-end developers who also know UI and UX."**

### 18. **Real Experience vs. Theory**

- **"Look at my code, and ask ChatGPT about it. See what it tells you."**
- That’s what real experience looks like—solving problems and building real-world projects.

### 19. **Longevity of Programming Languages**

- Real life doesn’t kill programming languages. Even older frameworks like **.NET** are still used in large applications, even though **.NET Core** may be faster.
- **"If I’ve built an app handling millions of dollars, why would I invest time and money to update the whole app?"**
