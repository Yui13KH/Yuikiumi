A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called

you can pass data, known as parameters , into a function

you define the function once and then you can reuse it define once and use it many times

you can either do a procedural function that doesnt return anything , using void 
or you can write a real function but you gotta explicitly type its type in cpp
