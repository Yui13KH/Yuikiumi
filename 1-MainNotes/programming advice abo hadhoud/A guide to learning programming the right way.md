### 1. **Eliminate Negative Influences**

Avoid following individuals who aren't successful. It's only logical to seek guidance from those who are already at the level you aspire to reach.

### 2. **Focus on Logic and Problem-Solving**

A programming language is merely a tool. True programming lies in mastering logic and problem-solving skills.

### 3. **Avoid Modern Languages for Deep Learning**

Modern programming languages often come with built-in functions, which can hinder your understanding of core concepts and prevent the development of a strong foundational knowledge.

### 4. **Solve 2000 Problems Using Older Languages**

Tackling problems in older programming languages will strengthen your foundation and improve your logical thinking, turning you into a true professional.

### 5. **Consider Specialization After Building Your Foundation**

Once you have a solid foundation, consider learning about databases or specializing in another area of interest.
