### **Types of Networks**

#### **1. Local Area Network (LAN)**

- A LAN connects a group of devices that are close to each other, typically within a single building or campus.
- Examples:
    - A school, workplace, or university network.
- Typically supports up to **100 devices** or more, depending on the setup.

#### **2. Wide Area Network (WAN)**

- A WAN connects multiple LANs over long distances, spanning cities, countries, or continents.
- Example:
    - The internet is the largest WAN.

### **Connection Types**

1. **Wired Connection**:
    
    - Uses cables (e.g., Ethernet) to connect devices to the network.
2. **Wireless Connection**:
    
    - Uses radio signals to connect devices without cables (e.g., Wi-Fi).

### **Communication Methods**

#### **Switch**

- A device used to connect multiple devices in a wired network via Ethernet.
- Ensures efficient communication between all connected devices.

#### **Router**

- A device that facilitates wireless communication (e.g., via Wi-Fi).
- Uses radio signals to connect devices without physical cables.

### **Protocols**

- **Protocol**: A standard set of rules that governs how devices communicate on a network.
- Protocols ensure devices can exchange data properly, whether through wires or wireless connections.
