### **What is a Programming Language?**

A **programming language** is a tool that helps humans write instructions (called **code**) for computers to perform specific tasks.

---

### **Types of Programming Languages**

#### **1. Machine Language**

- **Machine language** is the lowest-level programming language, written in **binary** or **hexadecimal**.
- It is directly understood by the computer without any need for conversion.
- **Drawback**: It's extremely hard for humans to read or write, so higher-level languages were created to make coding easier.

#### **2. Assembly Language**

- **Assembly language** is a step up from machine language and is more human-readable.
- It was the first attempt at creating a human-readable code while still being close to the machine’s binary.

#### **3. High-Level Languages**

- **High-level languages** are designed to be closer to human languages, making it easier for programmers to write instructions.
- **Example**: Writing “Hello, World” in **BASIC** is as simple as:
    
    basic
    
    Copy code
    
    `PRINT "Hello, World"`

### **What is a Translator?**

A **translator** is software that converts human-readable code into machine language so the computer can execute it.  
There are two main types of translators:

1. **Compiler**
    
    - A **compiler** takes the entire source code, converts it into **object code**, and then creates an executable file (**.exe**).
    - The compiled code is saved on disk, and when you run the program, a **loader** loads it into memory.
    - If you make changes to the source code, you must **re-compile** it.
    
    **How a Compiler Works:**
    
    1. The compiler scans the entire application source code.
    2. It checks for errors. If it finds any, it stops until the errors are fixed.
    3. It generates the object code and then creates the executable.
2. **Interpreter**
    
    - An **interpreter** runs the code **line-by-line** without a build step.
    - If an error occurs, it stops execution at that line.
    - You can edit the code directly without needing to re-interpret or recompile it.
    - **Note**: Interpreted languages do not save anything on the hard disk.

#### **Which is Faster: Compiled or Interpreted?**

- **Compiled languages** are faster in execution because, once compiled, the program is directly executable.
- **Interpreted languages** are slower because the code is read and executed line-by-line.

### **Examples of Programming Languages**

- **Compiled Languages**: C, C++
- **Interpreted Languages**: JavaScript, Ruby, Python

---

### **Source Code vs Object Code**

- **Source Code**: The human-readable code written in a high-level programming language.
- **Object Code**: The translated machine-readable code generated by a compiler or interpreter.

### **Programming Language Levels**

The hierarchy of programming languages is as follows:

1. **Hardware**: The physical computer.
2. **Binary Code**: The language that the hardware understands.
3. **Machine Language**: Low-level binary instructions or hex.
4. **Assembly Language**: A human-readable form of machine language.
5. **Middle-Level Languages**: e.g., C, C++ (closer to hardware).
6. **High-Level Languages**: e.g., Java, C#, VB (abstracted from hardware).
7. **Scripting/Interpreted Languages**: e.g., JavaScript, Python (interpreted code).

**Pro Tip**: The closer the language is to hardware, the faster it tends to be.

### **Assembler**

An **assembler** is a program specifically designed to convert assembly language into machine code.

### **Why Do We Have So Many Programming Languages?**

Different programming languages are designed for different purposes. It's like cars—each language has its own strengths and is better suited for particular tasks.  
There is **no one-size-fits-all**; choosing a language depends on the specific context or project requirements.

---

### **Why You Shouldn’t Start With High-Level Languages**

- High-level languages often come with built-in functions that can make you overly dependent on the language’s framework.
- Starting with low-level languages forces you to understand the fundamentals of programming, improving your logical and analytical thinking.
- **Don’t be "language-biased"**: All programming languages are valuable tools. Learn to use each language for what it’s best suited for.

### **Why C++ is the Best Language to Start With**

1. **Cross-platform**: Works on almost any OS without modification.
2. **Foundation for other languages**: Most modern languages are directly or indirectly based on C++.
3. **Supports both procedural and OOP**: Offers flexibility in programming paradigms.
4. **Concept mastery**: It will force you to learn core programming concepts.
5. **Fast learning of other languages**: Learning C++ well will make learning other languages faster.
6. **Close to hardware**: C++ allows you to manipulate low-level hardware resources, making it a powerful tool for performance-critical applications.
7. **Memory management**: It teaches you how to manage memory, leading to better optimization skills.
8. **Wide range of applications**: You can build anything from operating systems to game engines, databases, and embedded systems.

**C++ Examples**:

- Most of Windows is written in C++.
- Applications like YouTube, Amazon, Photoshop, Word, Excel, Chrome, Firefox, and even Internet Explorer are built using C++.
- Databases like **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**, and tools like **Visual Studio**, **Maya**, and **Blender** are all developed with C++.
