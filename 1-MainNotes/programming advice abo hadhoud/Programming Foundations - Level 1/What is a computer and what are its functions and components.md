A computer is an electronic device that:
1. **Takes inputs**: Accepts data through input devices. 
2. **Processes data**: Works on the data based on predefined rules or instructions (programs). 
3. **Outputs information**: Provides processed data as meaningful information.

## Functions of a Computer 
1. **Input Data**: Receives raw data through input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, sensors). 
2. **Stores Data**: Keeps data temporarily (RAM) or permanently (hard drive) for processing. 
3. **Processes Data**: Uses the CPU to convert raw data into useful information. 
4. **Outputs Information**: Sends the processed information to output devices like a monitor or printer. 
5. **Controls Operations**: Manages and coordinates all the above steps.

## Main Parts of a Computer 
### Input Devices 
Examples: Keyboard, mouse, microphone, scanner, camera. 
### Output Devices - Examples: Monitor, speakers, printer, VR headset. 
### Primary Memory (RAM and ROM) 
**RAM**: Temporary, volatile memory for running programs and processes.
**ROM**: Permanent, non-volatile memory containing essential system instructions (e.g., BIOS). 
### Secondary Storage
Used for long-term data storage. Examples: Hard drives (HDD), Solid State Drives (SSD), USB drives, CDs.
### CPU (Central Processing Unit) 
**Transistors**: Tiny switches that form the core of processing. 
**ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs mathematical and logical operations. 
**Control Unit**: Directs the flow of data and instructions. - 
**Cache**: Small, fast memory for frequently accessed data. - 
**Registers**: Ultra-fast storage for immediate processing tasks. 
### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) 
Specialized processor for rendering graphics and handling parallel computations. 
Essential for gaming, video editing, and AI workloads.
