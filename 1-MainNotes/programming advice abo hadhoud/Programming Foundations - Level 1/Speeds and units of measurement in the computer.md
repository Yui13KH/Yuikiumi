### CPU Speed, Cycles, and Hertz

- **CPU Speed** is primarily determined by the **frequency** of the processor, which is measured in **Hertz (Hz)**.
    - **Hertz (Hz)** refers to the number of cycles per second, representing how often the transistors inside the CPU turn on and off.
    - A higher frequency means the CPU can complete more operations per second.

### 32-bit vs 64-bit Processors

- The **bit** in **32-bit** and **64-bit** processors refers to how much data the CPU can handle at once and how much memory it can address.
    
    - **32-bit Processors**:
        
        - Can handle only **4GB of RAM**.
        - This is due to addressing limjitations, where the maximum addressable memory is 2^32 bytes (around 4GB).
    - **64-bit Processors**:
        
        - Can handle much more memory, theoretically supporting up to **16 exabytes of RAM** (though practical limits are much lower depending on the system and motherboard).
        - The increased bit-width allows the processor to address significantly more memory, which is particularly useful for applications requiring large memory resources.
