### **Watch Window**

- **Definition**: A debugging tool that allows you to monitor the values of variables or expressions during program execution.
- **Purpose**: Helps track changes to specific variables or expressions without stepping through every line of code.
- **Features**:
    - Add variables or custom expressions to the watch list.
    - Displays current values, including complex data types like structs or arrays.
    - Updates values in real time as the program runs or steps through code.
- **Use Case**:
    - Detect unexpected changes in variables.
    - Monitor how expressions evaluate at different execution points.
- **Tips**:
    - Use for key variables affecting program logic.
    - Combine with breakpoints for efficient debugging.
